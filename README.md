# Advent of Code 2019 - Rust

I wanted a use case to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and play around with it. 

Then, I remembered that I wanted to have done the Advent of Code in December. 

Both ideas came together and I'm doing it in a more relaxed approach, in February.


This is a delayed attempt to solve the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) in Rust.
